I developed a non-incremental online learning system using a parallelized Rreservoir (RNN) and the corresponding data-driven filter. Unlike long-term learning models, its strength lies in its ability to adapt flexibly to sudden changes in patterns.

For the summary of parallelized reservoir, see

We applied this method to predict SP500 and the result is as follows:

<b>
Accuracy = 0.762,<br>
F1 = 0.712,<br>
Recall = 0.721.
</b>

<br><br>

Using the filtered data, along with a correlation of 0.985 between the filtered data and original data, is considered a fairly robust result.
The following is a comparable result from our study:

Gonzalo López Gil, Paul Duhamel-Sebline, Andrew McCarren,
An Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Stock Market Trend Prediction
(2024)

Their result (using xLSTM-TS) is as follows:

Accuracy = 0.709,<br>
F1 = 0.730,<br>
Recall = 0.768.<br>

<br>

Although the learning performance is comparable, the point we wish to emphasize most is the following:

<H3>
xLSTM-TS: total learnable parameters = 125,389<br>
Online parallel reservoir: total learnable parameters ≈ 1,000

<br><br>

Despite the difference of several orders of magnitude in computational cost, the learning results are nearly identical. This clearly demonstrates the high potential of the online reservoir approach.
